## Running Game Designer Tests

### All Game Designer Tests:
```bash
make test-agent-game_designer
# or
pytest modules/agents/game_designer/tests/ -v
```

### Individual Test Files:
```bash
# Main agent tests
pytest modules/agents/game_designer/tests/test_game_designer_agent.py -v

# UX specification tests
pytest modules/agents/game_designer/tests/test_ux_specification_generator.py -v

# Game mechanics tests
pytest modules/agents/game_designer/tests/test_game_mechanics_designer.py -v

# Wireframe generation tests
pytest modules/agents/game_designer/tests/test_wireframe_generator.py -v

# DNA UX validation tests
pytest modules/agents/game_designer/tests/test_dna_ux_validator.py -v
```

## Quality Requirements

- **Coverage:** 95% minimum for agent logic
- **Performance:** < 30 seconds per test file
- **Reliability:** Must validate all UX design functionality

## Test Data

### Sample Story Breakdown (Input):
```python
sample_story_breakdown = {
    "story_id": "STORY-GH-123",
    "feature_summary": {
        "title": "Policy Practice Scenarios",
        "user_persona": "Anna",
        "time_constraint_minutes": 10
    },
    "user_stories": [
        {
            "story": "As Anna, I want to practice policy scenarios",
            "acceptance_criteria": [...]
        }
    ],
    "learning_objectives": [
        "Apply policy knowledge to practical situations"
    ]
}
```

### Sample UX Specification (Output):
```python
sample_ux_specification = {
    "ui_components": [
        {
            "name": "ScenarioSelector",
            "type": "interactive_list",
            "props": {...},
            "responsive_design": True
        }
    ],
    "game_mechanics": {
        "progression_system": {...},
        "feedback_mechanisms": {...},
        "engagement_patterns": [...]
    },
    "wireframes": [
        {
            "screen_name": "scenario_selection",
            "layout": {...},
            "user_flows": [...]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Contract Flow

Game Designer handles these contract transformations:

### Input (from Project Manager):
```json
{
  "source_agent": "project_manager",
  "target_agent": "game_designer",
  "input_requirements": {
    "required_data": {
      "story_breakdown": {...},
      "dna_analysis": {...},
      "complexity_assessment": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

### Output (to Developer):
```json
{
  "source_agent": "game_designer", 
  "target_agent": "developer",
  "input_requirements": {
    "required_data": {
      "ux_specification": {...},
      "game_mechanics": {...},
      "wireframes": {...},
      "component_library_mapping": {...}
    }
  }
}
```
