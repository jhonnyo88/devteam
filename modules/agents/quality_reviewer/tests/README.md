overall_score = (
    technical_quality * 0.25 +
    user_experience * 0.25 +
    learning_effectiveness * 0.25 +
    business_value * 0.25
)
```

## Quality Thresholds

### Deployment Approval Thresholds:
- **Overall Quality Score**: ≥ 90 (Excellent), ≥ 80 (Good), < 80 (Needs Improvement)
- **Technical Quality**: ≥ 85 minimum
- **Accessibility**: ≥ 95% WCAG compliance
- **Learning Effectiveness**: ≥ 4.0/5.0
- **Performance**: Lighthouse score ≥ 90

### Blocking Criteria:
- Security vulnerabilities (Critical/High)
- Accessibility failures (WCAG AA violations)
- Performance degradation (> 20% slower)
- Learning effectiveness < 3.5/5.0

## Decision Making Process

### Approval Flow:
1. **Quality Analysis** - Comprehensive assessment
2. **Deployment Validation** - Readiness checking
3. **Risk Assessment** - Potential issue identification
4. **Decision Making** - Approve/reject/iterate
5. **Documentation** - Decision reasoning and recommendations

### Decision Criteria:
- All quality thresholds met
- No blocking issues identified
- Deployment readiness confirmed
- Stakeholder requirements satisfied

## Integration Points

Quality Reviewer integrates with:
- **QA Tester** - Via contract input
- **Deployment System** - Via contract output
- **Quality Dashboard** - For reporting
- **Audit System** - For decision tracking
