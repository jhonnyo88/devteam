The system integrates with municipal HR systems, validates against approved government domains, and creates personalized learning pathways based on department and role. The registration process itself serves as the first learning experience, teaching employees about digital security, GDPR compliance, and their role in municipal service delivery. Users complete a guided onboarding that connects their daily work responsibilities to broader municipal goals while setting up their professional development profile.\n\n## \ud83d\udc65 Target User\n**Primary Persona:** Anna (Municipal Training Coordinator)\n**Alternative Persona:** Municipal employees across all departments\n\n## \ud83c\udf93 Learning Objectives\n- [ ] Understand proper municipal account setup procedures\n- [ ] Learn about role-based access to training materials\n- [ ] Practice secure password creation and account management\n- [ ] Familiarize with GDPR consent and data handling policies\n\n## \u2705 Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] User can register with valid municipal email address (@kommun.se domains)\n- [ ] System validates email domain against approved municipal domains list\n- [ ] Registration form captures: name, email, department, role, municipality\n- [ ] System sends email verification link within 2 minutes\n- [ ] User can verify email and activate account within 24 hours\n- [ ] Profile setup includes accessibility preferences and learning goals\n- [ ] System assigns appropriate role permissions based on department\n- [ ] Registration process completes within 3 minutes for typical user\n- [ ] GDPR consent is properly captured and documented\n- [ ] System rejects invalid/non-municipal email addresses with clear messaging\n- [ ] Password requirements meet Swedish government security standards\n- [ ] Feature works within 10 minutes completion time constraint\n\n## \u23f1\ufe0f Time Constraints\n**Maximum completion time:** 10 minutes\n**Target completion time:** 5 minutes for experienced municipal users\n\n## \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Municipal Context\n**Department:** HR, Education, Administration (all departments)\n**Use case scenario:** \nAnna coordinates comprehensive professional development for Stockholm municipality's 45,000 employees. She needs a registration system that not only provides platform access but also educates employees about their role in municipal service excellence. The system must integrate with existing municipal workflows, respect employee time constraints, and provide immediate value by connecting individual learning goals to departmental objectives and citizen service improvements.\n\n**Policy alignment:**\n- Swedish GDPR implementation (UAVV)\n- Government security guidelines for user authentication\n- Municipal employment verification procedures\n- Accessibility requirements per DOS (Diskrimineringsombudsmannen)\n\n## \ud83c\udfae Game Design Requirements\n**Interaction type:** Progressive learning journey with gamified milestones\n**Pedagogical approach:** Constructivist learning through guided discovery of municipal service connections\n**Difficulty level:** Beginner (adaptive to all technical skill levels with professional municipal context)\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Success Metrics\n- User completion rate: >95%\n- User satisfaction score: >4.2/5.0\n- Average completion time: <5 minutes\n- Email verification rate: >90% within 24 hours\n- Support ticket reduction: 80% fewer registration-related issues\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 Priority Justification\n**Why is this important?**\nThis foundational feature transforms routine account creation into meaningful professional development. By integrating holistic municipal service principles into the registration process, employees immediately understand how their learning connects to citizen service excellence. The system respects busy municipal professionals' time while establishing a culture of continuous improvement that supports both individual growth and organizational effectiveness.\n\n**Urgency level:** High - Required foundation enabling municipal service excellence through learning\n",
