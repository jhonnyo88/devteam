# DigiNativa Agent Contract Testing

## 🎯 Purpose

This document describes DigiNativa's comprehensive contract testing system that ensures our 6-agent AI development team remains functionally integrated even when individual agents are modified or enhanced.

## 🔄 How It Works

Our contract testing system acts as a **"safety net"** that validates the entire agent workflow through automated contract validation. If the contract tests pass, you can be confident that the team integration is intact.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
GitHub Issue
     ↓ [Contract: analysis_to_design]
Project Manager
     ↓ [Contract: design_to_implementation]  
Game Designer
     ↓ [Contract: implementation_to_testing]
Developer
     ↓ [Contract: testing_to_qa]
Test Engineer
     ↓ [Contract: qa_to_quality_review]
QA Tester
     ↓ [Contract: quality_review_to_deployment]

```

Each arrow represents a **validated contract** that ensures compatibility between agents.

## 📋 Contract Validation Levels

### 1. Core Contract Validation
- **Complete Chain Compatibility**: PM → Game Designer → Developer → Test Engineer → QA Tester → Quality Reviewer
- **DNA Compliance Preservation**: All 5 design + 4 architecture principles maintained
- **Quality Gates Progression**: Quality requirements increase appropriately at each stage
- **Version Compatibility**: All contracts use compatible versions
- **Story ID Propagation**: Story identifiers correctly flow through entire chain

### 2. Requirements Chain Validation
- **Performance Requirements**: API <200ms, Lighthouse ≥90 maintained throughout
- **Security Requirements**: Zero critical/high vulnerabilities enforced
- **Coverage Requirements**: 95% integration, 90% E2E coverage validated

### 3. Compatibility Validation
- **Schema Stability**: Contract schemas remain stable across agent updates
- **Agent Sequence**: Correct agent-to-agent handoff sequence maintained
- **Performance Budget Consistency**: Performance budgets consistent across contracts

### 4. Pipeline Validation
- **Processing Performance**: Contract validation remains fast (<1s for full chain)
- **Memory Usage**: No memory leaks in contract processing
- **Error Handling**: Contract validation errors handled gracefully
- **Concurrent Processing**: Contracts work correctly with parallel processing

### 5. Regression Validation
- **Field Addition Safety**: New fields don't break existing contracts
- **Field Removal Detection**: Removing required fields is caught
- **Type Consistency**: Contract types remain consistent across versions

## 🚀 Running Contract Tests

### Quick Validation
```bash
# Full contract validation suite
python scripts/validate_contracts.py

# Fast validation (skip performance tests)
python scripts/validate_contracts.py --fast

# Verbose output for debugging
python scripts/validate_contracts.py --verbose
```

### Agent-Specific Validation
```bash
# Validate specific agent contracts
python scripts/validate_contracts.py --agent test_engineer
python scripts/validate_contracts.py --agent developer
python scripts/validate_contracts.py --agent qa_tester
```

### Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Run core contract tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_agent_contracts.py -v

# Run pipeline performance tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_contract_pipeline.py -v

# Run specific test class
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_agent_contracts.py::TestAgentContractFlow -v
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Before Modifying Any Agent

1. **Run baseline validation**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/validate_contracts.py --verbose
   ```

2. **Ensure all tests pass** before making changes

### After Modifying Agent Code

1. **Run contract validation**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/validate_contracts.py --agent YOUR_AGENT
   ```

2. **Run full validation suite**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/validate_contracts.py
   ```

3. **Fix any contract issues** before committing

### Pre-Commit Validation

Our pre-commit hook automatically runs contract validation:

```bash
# Install the pre-commit hook
cp .githooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Now every commit will validate contracts automatically
git commit -m "Your changes"
```

## 📊 Understanding Test Results

```

### ❌ Failure Output
```
❌ complete_contract_chain failed: ValidationError: Field 'target_agent' missing

❌ 1 VALIDATION(S) FAILED!
🚨 Do not proceed with agent modifications until contracts are fixed!
```

## 🔍 Test Categories

### Core Tests (Always Run)
- **`test_complete_contract_chain_compatibility`**: Master test - if this passes, integration works
- **`test_dna_compliance_preservation`**: DNA compliance maintained throughout chain
- **`test_quality_gates_progression`**: Quality gates properly validated
- **`test_contract_version_compatibility`**: Version compatibility maintained
- **`test_story_id_propagation`**: Story IDs correctly propagated

### Requirements Tests
- **`test_performance_requirements_chain`**: Performance requirements maintained
- **`test_security_requirements_chain`**: Security requirements maintained  
- **`test_coverage_requirements_chain`**: Coverage requirements maintained

## 🚨 Critical Guidelines

### DO Run Contract Tests When:
- ✅ Modifying any agent code
- ✅ Adding new contract fields
- ✅ Changing agent logic
- ✅ Updating contract models
- ✅ Before committing code
- ✅ Before merging pull requests

### DON'T Commit If:
- ❌ Contract validation fails
- ❌ Performance degradation detected
- ❌ Security requirements not met
- ❌ Quality gates failing
- ❌ Agent sequence broken

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Contract Version Mismatch
```
Error: Only contract version 1.0 is currently supported
```
**Solution**: Ensure all contracts use version "1.0"

#### Missing Required Fields
```
Error: Missing required field 'dna_compliance'
```
**Solution**: Add missing field to contract with proper structure

#### Agent Sequence Violation
```
Error: Expected target_agent 'test_engineer', got 'qa_tester'
```
**Solution**: Fix agent sequence in contract configuration

#### Performance Degradation
```
Error: Contract processing too slow: 2.15s
```
**Solution**: Optimize contract processing logic or validate performance requirements

### Debug Mode

For detailed debugging:
```bash
# Maximum verbosity
python scripts/validate_contracts.py --verbose

# Debug specific test
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_agent_contracts.py::TestAgentContractFlow::test_complete_contract_chain_compatibility -v -s

# Run with Python debugger
python -m pdb scripts/validate_contracts.py
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions
Our GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs contract validation on:
- Every push to main/develop branches
- Every pull request
- Changes to agent code
- Changes to test code

### Pre-commit Hooks
Automatic validation before every commit prevents contract issues from entering the repository.

## 📚 Advanced Usage

### Custom Validation
```python
# Add custom contract validation
from tests.integration.test_agent_contracts import TestAgentContractFlow

test_flow = TestAgentContractFlow()

# Validate custom scenario
def test_custom_validation():
    story_id = "STORY-CUSTOM-001"
    pm_output = test_flow._create_valid_pm_output(story_id)
    # Add custom assertions
    assert pm_output["custom_field"] == "expected_value"
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
# Monitor contract processing performance
import time
from tests.integration.test_contract_pipeline import TestContractPipeline

test_pipeline = TestContractPipeline()

start_time = time.time()
test_pipeline.test_contract_processing_performance()
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Validation time: {end_time - start_time:.3f}s")
```
