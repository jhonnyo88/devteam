# EventBus Integration Prompts for Agent-Specific AIs

## üéØ CRITICAL INTEGRATION REQUIREMENT

EventBus integration is **THE BLOCKING ISSUE** preventing DigiNativa AI team from working as a cohesive unit. All 6 agents need EventBus integration to enable real-time team coordination.

**Current Status: 0/6 agents have EventBus integration**
**Result: Team cannot coordinate, no pipeline orchestration possible**

---

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

Each agent-specific AI should implement EventBus integration following this exact pattern:

### 1. Import EventBus in Agent Constructor
```python
from ...shared.event_bus import EventBus

# In __init__ method:
self.event_bus = EventBus(config)
```

### 2. Add Team Coordination Methods
```python
async def _notify_team_progress(self, event_type: str, data: Dict[str, Any]):
    """Notify team of progress via EventBus."""
    await self.event_bus.publish(event_type, {
        "agent": self.agent_type,
        "story_id": data.get("story_id"),
        "status": data.get("status"),
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        **data
    })

async def _listen_for_team_events(self):
    """Listen for relevant team events."""
    relevant_events = [f"{self.agent_type}_*", "team_*", "pipeline_*"]
    for event_pattern in relevant_events:
        await self.event_bus.subscribe(event_pattern, self._handle_team_event)

async def _handle_team_event(self, event_type: str, data: Dict[str, Any]):
    """Handle incoming team coordination events."""
    self.logger.info(f"Received team event: {event_type}")
    # Agent-specific event handling logic
```

### 3. Integration Points in process_contract()
```python
# At start of processing
await self._notify_team_progress("agent_started", {"story_id": story_id})

# At major milestones
await self._notify_team_progress("agent_milestone", {
    "story_id": story_id, 
    "milestone": "major_step_completed"
})

# At completion
await self._notify_team_progress("agent_completed", {"story_id": story_id})
```

## üìä TEAM COORDINATION IMPACT

**Before EventBus Integration (Current State):**
- ‚ùå Agents work in isolation
- ‚ùå No real-time progress visibility
- ‚ùå No pipeline orchestration possible
- ‚ùå No team intelligence sharing
- ‚ùå Cannot test end-to-end workflow

**After EventBus Integration (Target State):**
- ‚úÖ Real-time team coordination
- ‚úÖ Pipeline progress visibility
- ‚úÖ Automated workflow orchestration
- ‚úÖ AI intelligence sharing across agents
- ‚úÖ End-to-end pipeline testing possible

---

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

Each agent integration is complete when:

1. **EventBus Import**: Agent imports and initializes EventBus correctly
2. **Team Events**: Agent publishes relevant progress events
3. **Event Listening**: Agent listens for relevant team coordination events
4. **Contract Integration**: EventBus calls integrated into process_contract() method
5. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality preserved 100%

**CRITICAL**: Test that agents can publish/receive events without breaking existing contract validation or functionality.

---

## üí° IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

**Execute these prompts in parallel - all agents need EventBus integration simultaneously for team coordination to work.**

EventBus integration is the foundation for:
- Pipeline orchestration
- Real-time progress tracking
- Team intelligence sharing
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Production-ready team deployment

**This is the #1 blocking issue for DigiNativa AI team production readiness.**
