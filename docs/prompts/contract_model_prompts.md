# Contract Model Implementation Prompts for Agent-Specific AIs

## üéØ CRITICAL CONTRACT COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT

Contract models are **ESSENTIAL** for DigiNativa's modular architecture. Only Project Manager has complete contract models - all other agents need Pydantic contract models for type safety and validation.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Project Manager**: Complete (input_models.py + output_models.py)
- ‚ùå **Game Designer**: Missing contract models 
- ‚ùå **Developer**: Missing contract models
- ‚ùå **Test Engineer**: Missing contract models
- ‚ùå **QA Tester**: Missing contract models
- ‚ùå **Quality Reviewer**: Missing contract models

## üìã CONTRACT MODEL REQUIREMENTS

Each agent needs both input and output contract models following this structure:

### Required Files per Agent:
```
modules/agents/{agent_name}/contracts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input_models.py    # Pydantic models for incoming contracts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output_models.py   # Pydantic models for outgoing contracts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py        # Package initialization
```

### Pydantic Model Standards:
- **BaseModel inheritance** with Field validation
- **JSON schema compatibility** matching agent_contract_schema.json
- **DNA compliance structure** embedded in all contracts
- **Contract metadata** (version, source_agent, target_agent)
- **Example schema_extra** for documentation

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS

### Directory Structure per Agent:
```
modules/agents/{agent_name}/contracts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py                 # Package init with exports
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input_models.py            # Pydantic input contracts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ output_models.py           # Pydantic output contracts
```

### Required Imports:
```python
from typing import Dict, Any, List, Optional
from datetime import datetime
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
```

### Base Contract Structure:
```python
class AgentOutputContract(BaseModel):
    # Contract metadata
    contract_version: str = Field("1.0", description="Contract version")
    source_agent: str = Field("agent_name", description="Source agent type")
    target_agent: str = Field("target_agent", description="Target agent type")
    timestamp: str = Field(default_factory=lambda: datetime.now().isoformat())
    
    # Story identification
    story_id: str = Field(..., description="Unique story identifier")

## üí° INTEGRATION PRIORITY

**Execute these prompts in parallel - all agents need contract models for type-safe communication.**

Contract models enable:
- Type-safe agent communication
- Runtime contract validation
- Clear agent interface documentation
- IDE support for development
- Easier debugging and testing

**This is a critical requirement for production-ready agent communication.**
